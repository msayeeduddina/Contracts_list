# Contracts primarily for off-chain consumption

This directory contains data aggregation contracts that are primarily intended to be consumed off-chain.

Prior to using any of these contracts for on-chain purposes, confirm that:

1. it has been audited
2. the logic is suitable for on-chain use (gas, state changes, etc)
