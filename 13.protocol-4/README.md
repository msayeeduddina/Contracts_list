## Using this Repository

### A Tale of Two Frameworks

:construction:

This repo is currently in-flux for a gradual move from Hardhat to Foundry. All production contracts continue to live in `contracts/persistent/` and `contracts/release/` (deployed contracts [here](https://docs.enzyme.finance/developers/contracts)).

If you are looking for the legacy test suite & test coverage please refer to the [hardhat branch](https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol/tree/hardhat).

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following installed:

- [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Then, clone this repository:

```
git clone [GIT_REPOSITORY_URL]
```

### Compile Contracts

Generate internal interfaces for foundry deployment and tests:

```sh
make build
```

### Run Tests

First, create your `.env` file by copying `.env.example`. Input your Ethereum (and/or other networks) node endpoint info as-needed (generally, only setting `ETHEREUM_NODE_MAINNET`, `ETHEREUM_NODE_POLYGON`, etc is fine).

Then, in order to run the test suite:

```sh
make test
```

You can also manually run parts of the test suite using `forge` directly, e.g:

```sh
forge test --match-test <REGEX>
```
